        <p>The purpose of blackjack is to get a higher card count than the dealer, while remaining at or under 21.</p>
        <p>Going over 21 results in a bust, and hitting 21 exactly is a blackjack.</p>
        <p>Press the 'hit' button to take another card, and the 'stand' button to keep what you have.</p>
        <p>The dealer will begin with one card, and will always hit at 16, and will always stand at 17.</p>
        <p>There is no betting in this version, and some rules such as splitting cards are removed.</p>
        <p>There is only room for 9 cards in a hand. If you get 9 cards, you will automatically stand.</p>
        <p>If you tie the dealer, neither a win nor loss is counted.</p>
        <p>Aces automatically count for 11, and if you go bust with one in your hand it automatically changes to 1.</p>
